# Customize-Flappy

Flappy Bird Game made on Python
AI uses the NEAT algorithm to play by itself

Future Scope:
1. Smoothly choose your own character, base, pipe, and background
2. Auto resize the custom images
3. Decide on one successful test and only play that algorithm instead of always running 50 birds
4. Eliminate initial frame drop



Different modes tried till now:
